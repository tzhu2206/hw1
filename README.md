This project is a website for a photography business run by an individual photographer, with examples of his work.
The website contains five HTML pages:
    1) A home page, with four sample images linked to the other four pages
    2) A page featuring examples of cityscape and street photography, with links to learn more about specific locations
    3) A page featuring examples of animal and nature photography, with descriptions of each
    4) A page listing examples, description, and pricing for paid/commissioned photography work
    5) A page featuring some pieces of equipment that the photographer uses, linked to online storefronts where viewers can purchase them
